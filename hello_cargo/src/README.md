# Hello, Cargo!

[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) is Rust's build system and package manager. This directory contains a hello world program created using:

```Rust
cargo new hello_cargo --vcs none
```

It also contains a `launch.json` file containing Launch Configurations for running and debugging this example in VSCode.
