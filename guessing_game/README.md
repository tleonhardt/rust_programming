# Programming a Guessing Game

This example is from Chapter 2 of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).

This is a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Hereâ€™s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.
